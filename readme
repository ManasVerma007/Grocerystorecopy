About Project-
The web application, built with Flask and Jinja2, is a multi-user platform that streamlines grocery shopping for users. It enables store managers to efficiently manage inventory, allowing users to browse and purchase products from various categories. The app allows store managers to add new sections, categories, and products to keep the platform up-to-date. With a secured user authentication and authorization system, privacy and control are enhanced. The user interface is intuitive, featuring a user-friendly shopping cart for a seamless shopping experience. Real-time inventory tracking ensures stock levels are maintained, avoiding out-of-stock situations.
